## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following installed on your system:

* **PHP** (version compatible with your Laravel setup)
* **Composer**
* **Node.js & npm** (optional, depending on your Laravel version and asset compilation needs)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd [YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME]
    ```

2.  **Install PHP dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Set up the environment file:**
    Copy the example environment file and generate an application key.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    ```
    *(Note: This portfolio is primarily static HTML/CSS with some Laravel blade templating, so database configuration in `.env` might not be strictly necessary.)*

4.  **Install Node dependencies and compile assets (if needed):**
    If your project uses compiled CSS/JS assets, run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev  # or npm run build
    ```

### Running the Application

To view the website, use the Laravel development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```
The application will typically be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
